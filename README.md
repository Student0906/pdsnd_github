### Project Title
**Exploring the US Bike Share Data**

### Description
Over the past decade, **Bicycle-Sharing** systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these **Bicycle-Sharing** systems are used.



### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. These cities are: _Chicago, New York City and Washington_. These files are;
```
 `chicago.csv`
 `new_york_city.csv`
 `washington.csv` 
 ```
 
 These file contain the same core six (6) columns:

    Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
    End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
    Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
    Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
    End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
    User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

    Gender
    Birth Year
